# Exercise 2: Working with Azure Artifacts

In this exercise, you will learn how to work with Azure Artifacts by using the following steps:

- Create and connect to a feed.
- Create and publish a NuGet package.
- Import a NuGet package.
- Update a NuGet package.

## Task 1: Create and connect to a feed

In this task, you will create and connect to a feed.

1. In the web browser window displaying your project settings in the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane, select **Artifacts**.
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_12.png)

1. With the **Artifacts** hub displayed, select organization **odluser-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(1)** and click **+ Create feed (2)** at the top of the pane. 

    > **Note**: This feed will be a collection of NuGet packages available to users within the organization and will sit alongside the public NuGet feed as a peer. The scenario in this lab will focus on the workflow for using Azure Artifacts, so the actual architectural and development decisions are purely illustrative.  This feed will include common functionality that can be shared across projects in this organization. 
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_013.png)

1. On the **Create new feed** pane, in the **Name** textbox, type **EShopOnWebShared (1)**, in the **Scope** section, select the **Organization (2)** option, leave other settings with their default values, and click **Create (3)**. 

    > **Note**: Any user who wants to connect to this NuGet feed must configure their environment. 
    
    ![](images/createnewfeed.png)
    
1. Back on the **Artifacts** hub, select **EShopOnWebShared** **(1)** Organization, click **Connect to feed (2)**.

    ![](images/new-image5.png)
           
1. On the **Connect to feed** pane, in the **NuGet** section, select **Visual Studio (1)** and, on the **Visual Studio** pane, copy the **Source (2)** url.
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_(16).png)

1. Switch back to the **Visual Studio** window.

1. In the Visual Studio window, click **Tools (1)** menu header, in the dropdown menu, select **NuGet Package Manager (2)** and, in the cascading menu, select **Package Manager Settings (3)**.
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_17.png)
    
1. In the **Options** dialog box, click **Package Sources** and click the plus sign to add a new package source.

1. At the bottom of the dialog box, in the **Name** textbox, replace **Package Sources (1)** with **EShopOnWebShared (2)** and, in the **Source** textbox, paste the **Source URL (3)** you copied in the Azure DevOps portal and click **Update (4)** and then click **OK (5)** to finalize the addition. 
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_(18)(1).png)
     
    > **Note**: Visual Studio is now connected to the new feed.

1. Close and reopen the other Visual Studio instance you used for cloning the EShopOnWeb repository, to account for the artifact source update and open the **EShopOnWeb** solution. You will need it in the third task of this exercise.

    ![](images/az-400-image8.png)

    >**Note**: If your not able to see **EShopOnWeb** solution, click on **Open a local folder** and select **EShopOnWeb** > **Select folder**. 

## Task 2: Create and publish a NuGet package

In this task, you will create and publish a NuGet package.

1. In the Visual Studio window you used to configure the new package source, in the main menu, click **File (1)**, in the dropdown menu, click **New (2)** and then, in the cascading menu, click **Project (3)**. 

    > **Note**: We will now create a shared assembly that will be published as a NuGet package so that other teams can integrate it and stay up to date without having to work directly with the project source.
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_19.png)

1. On the **Recent project templates** page of the **Create a new project** pane, use the search textbox to locate the **Class Library (1)** template, select the template for **C# (2)**, and click **Next (3)**. 
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_20.png)

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** or **Right-click** on the **EShopOnWeb.Shared Project (1)** and select **Build (2)** to build the project.. 

   > **Note**: In the next task we'll use **NuGet.exe** to generate a NuGet package directly from the built project, but it requires the project to be built first.

   ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_25.png)
    
   ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_26.png)
   
1. Switch to the web browser displaying the Azure DevOps portal.

    ```
     cd C:\Users\azureuser\source\repos\EShopOnWeb.Shared\EShopOnWeb.Shared
    ```

1. Run the following to create a .nupkg file from the project. Replace **[DID]** with **<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>** in the below command.

    ```
     dotnet pack --output C:\Users\azureuser\source\repos\EShopOnWeb.Shared\EShopOnWeb.Shared\bin\Release  /p:PackageVersion=[DID].0.0 --configuration Release
    ```

    ```
    

1. Run the following to publish the package to the **eShopOnWebShared** feed.Replace **[DID]** with **<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>** in the below command.

    ```
    dotnet nuget push --source "eShopOnWebShared" --api-key az C:\Users\azureuser\source\repos\EShopOnWeb.Shared\EShopOnWeb.Shared\bin\Release\EShopOnWeb.Shared.[DID].0.0.nupkg --interactive
    ```

1. When prompted to login through the device login, copy the link in a new browser and copy the code displayed in your powershell window and sign in.

   ![](images/az-400l1.png)

1. After signing in the browser back in the powershell window Wait for the confirmation of the successful package push operation.   

1. Switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal and, in the vertical navigational pane, select **Artifacts**.

1. On the **Artifacts(1)** hub pane, click the dropdown list in the upper left corner and, in the list of feeds, select the **EShopOnWebShared(2)** entry.

   > **Note**: The **EShopOnWebShared** feed should include the newly published NuGet package.

   ![](images/az-400l2.png)
    
1. Click the NuGet package to display its details.

   ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_(38).png)

## Task 3: Import an Open-Source NuGet package to the Azure DevOps Package Feed

Besides developing your own packages, why not using the Open Source NuGet (<https://www.nuget.org>) DotNet Package library? With a few million packages available, there will always be something useful for your application.

In this task, we will use a generic "Newtonsoft.Json" sample package, but you can use the same approach for other packages in the library.

1. From the same PowerShell window, run the following **dotnet** command to install the sample package.

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --interactive
    ```
1. It will show additional output regarding the actual installation process itself.

    ```powershell
    Determining projects to restore...

    ```
1. The Newtonsoft.Json package got installed in the Packages as **Newtonsoft.Json**. From the Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, navigate to the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Project, expand Dependencies, and notice the **Newtonsoft.Json** under the Packages. Click on the little arrow to the left of the Packages, to open the folder and file list.

   ![](images/new-image2.png)

## Task 4: Check on the Packages installed in Visual Studio

1. From the Visual Studio **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Solution, right-click the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Project, and select **Manage NuGet Packages** from the context menu.

1. From the NuGet Package Manager window, validate the **Package Source** is set to **EShopOnWebShared**.

    ![](images/new-image1.png)

1. Click **Browse**, and wait for the list of NuGet Packages to load.

1. This list will also show both the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** custom-developed package, as well as the **Newtonsoft.Json** public sourced package.You might have to search for it in the search bar for the packages to appear.

    
   > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
