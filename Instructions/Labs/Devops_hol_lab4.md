# Lab 4: Controlling Deployments using Release Gates 

## Estimated timing: 70 minutes

## Lab Scenario

You are a DevOps engineer for Contoso.ltd, tasked with implementing a safe and controlled deployment process for a mission-critical .NET web application hosted in Azure. In this lab, you will configure a multi-stage release pipeline in Azure DevOps that deploys the app to two environments: Canary and Production. You will first define release gates to ensure the Canary deployment proceeds only when there are no high-severity bugs logged in the work item tracking system. You will then configure post-deployment gates that evaluate Application Insights telemetry to verify application health before promoting the release to Production. This lab demonstrates how to automate gradual rollouts, monitor real-time usage metrics, and use approvals and gate logic to enforce compliance and operational readiness. Your objective is to minimize risk and ensure only healthy builds are promoted across environments, aligning with Contoso’s standards for secure and reliable software delivery.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will be performing the following exercises:

- Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites
- Exercise 1: Creating the necessary Azure Resources for the Release Pipeline
- Exercise 2: Configure the release pipeline
- Exercise 3: Configure release gates
- Exercise 4: Test release gates

1. There should be at least **1** new alert in the list of results, having a **Severity 2**.

1. Notice there should be at least **1 Failed_Alert** with **Severity 2 - Warning** showing up in the list. This got triggered when you validated the non-existent website URL address in the previous exercise.

     > **Note:** If no Alert shows up yet, wait another few minutes. 

1. Return to the Azure DevOps Portal, open the **eShopOnWeb_MultiStageYAML** Project. Navigate to **Pipelines (1)**, select **Releases (2)**, and select the **New Release Pipeline (3)**. Click the **Create Release (4)** button.

1. Wait for the Canary release Stage to complete successfully. Notice how the **Post-deployment Gates** are switching to the **Evaluation** Gates status.

1. Let the Release pipeline run in the pending state for the next 5 minutes.
   
1. This is expected behavior, since there is an Application Insights alert triggered for the Canary Web App.

1. Wait another 3 minutes and validate the status of the Release Gates again. Click on the **Deployment (1)** icon. As it is now +8 minutes after the initial Release Gates got checked, and it's been more than 8 minutes since the initial Application Insight Alert got triggered with action "Fired", it should result in a successful Release Gate, having allowed the deployment of the Production Release Stage as well **(2)**.
